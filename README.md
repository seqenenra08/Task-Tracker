# Task Manager

A simple task manager built with PHP that allows you to add, list, update, delete, and change the status of tasks. Tasks are stored in a JSON file (`task.json`).

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Add tasks with a description.
- **List Tasks**: Display all tasks or filter them by status (`to do`, `in-progress`, `done`).
- **Update Tasks**: Update the description of a specific task.
- **Delete Tasks**: Delete a task using its ID.
- **Change Status**: 
  - `mark-in-progress`: Mark a task as "in-progress".
  - `mark-done`: Mark a task as "done".
- **File Support**: Automatically creates the `task.json` file if it doesn't exist.

---

## Requirements

- PHP 8.0 or higher.
- The `task.json` file will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.
